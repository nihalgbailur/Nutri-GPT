## 🚑 Fixing "pip install" Build Failures on macOS (NumPy, Pandas, etc.)

If you see errors like:

> error: subprocess-exited-with-error
> ...
> fatal error: 'type\_traits' file not found
> ...
> error: metadata-generation-failed

Or if `pip install -r requirements.txt` fails while building **NumPy**, **Pandas**, or other scientific Python libraries, **the most common cause is using Python 3.13 (which is too new for these packages as of June 2025)**.

### 🛠️ Solution: Use Python 3.11 or 3.10 Instead of 3.13

#### **Step 1. Install Python 3.11**

If you use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```bash
brew install python@3.11
```

#### **Step 2. Create a New Virtual Environment with Python 3.11**

In your project folder:

```bash
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### **Step 3. Upgrade pip, setuptools, wheel**

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

#### **Step 4. Install Project Requirements**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### **Step 5. Verify All Packages Installed**

```bash
pip list
```

If you see `numpy`, `pandas`, etc. listed, you’re ready!

### ❗ Why Not Python 3.13?

Most Python data science packages take time to support the very latest Python releases.

You may see errors like `'type_traits' file not found` or `metadata-generation-failed`.

**Python 3.11 and 3.10 are very stable and widely supported** for data science and AI work.

---

### 💡 If You Already Have Python 3.13 venv

If you already made a virtual environment with Python 3.13:

**Delete it:**

```bash
rm -rf venv
```

Then follow the steps above to recreate with Python 3.11.

### 🧑‍💻 For Apple Silicon (M1/M2) Macs

If you get “Xcode command line tools not found” errors:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

But you **still need Python 3.11** for data packages.

---

## 🧾 Summary

* Use **Python 3.11** for maximum compatibility.
* Create your venv with:

  ```bash
  python3.11 -m venv venv
  ```
* Upgrade pip and setuptools:

  ```bash
  pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
  ```
* Install your project dependencies:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
* Check your Python version:

  ```bash
  python --version
  ```

  It should show `Python 3.11.x`.
